in this project it was required to create 3 threads using C.We also needed to determine the order of running of each of the threads so we used 2 scheduling algorithms(First In First Out and Round Robin).We also prvided a 
 provide a detailed analysis of the following performance metrics for the First In First Out and Round Robin Scheduling algorithms we have used: 
Execution time, release time (inputs at the beginning of the schedulers), start time, finish time, 
waiting time, response time, turnaround time, CPU useful work, CPU Utilization, memory 
consumption.
